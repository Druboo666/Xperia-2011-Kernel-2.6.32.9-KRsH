<@fill>TSDX will integrate the sd-ext partition on your SDCard with the ROM in this Slot. The following will be linked to the sd-ext partition:</@>

<*>/data/app (Application APK's)</*>
<*>/data/app-asec (encrypted apps)</*>
<*>/data/app_s (Sense APK's)</*>
<*>/data/app-private (Private app/data)</*>
<*>/data/framework_s (Sense framework)</*>
<*>/data/lib_s (Sense libraries)</*>

The above data will be shared between any slot that has TSDX enabled.

Additionally, /data/system will be linked to /sd-ext/system_slot# (not shared). This can contain system data such as Wifi/Bluetooth connections, MIUI theme resources, and other misc. system data that is not essential for maximum performance.

<b>Press Next to enable TSDX for this Slot.</b>
