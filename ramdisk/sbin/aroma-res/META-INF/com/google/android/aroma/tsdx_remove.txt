<@fill>This process will remove the TSDX sd-ext function from the ROM in this Slot. The following will be moved back to the internal data partition:</@>

<*>/sd-ext/app_s (Sense APK's)</*>
<*>/sd-ext/app-private (Private app/data)</*>
<*>/sd-ext/framework_s (Sense framework)</*>
<*>/sd-ext/lib_s (Sense libraries)</*>
<*>/sd-ext/system_slot# (to /data/system)</*>

<#d33>WARNING - The following will <b>NOT</b> be moved back to internal data:</#>
<*>/data/app (Application APK's)</*>
<*>/data/app-asec (encrypted apps)</*>

The internal user application will be created new (empty). This is to avoid space issues. If you wish to keep these apps, boot the ROM now and back them up!

After the removal process, you will have the option to delete the TSDX folders on /sd-ext. This is recommended to keep sd-ext clean, but only if you are not still using TSDX in another slot.

<b>Press Next to remove TSDX for this Slot.</b>
